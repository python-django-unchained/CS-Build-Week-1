    "forest_landscapes": ["You stand in a flat terrain covered with diverse trees and gigantic grass.  You can see a stream miles away and a fort nearby.  The temperature is hot and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a flat region scattered with evergreen shrubs.  You can see the ocean to the east.  The temperature is a little cool and the sky is mostly clear.", "You stand in a flat area dotted with small trees, shrubs, and strange-looking grass.  You can see a marsh not too far away.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is partially cloudy.", "A jade patch of grass is neighbored by aromatic hedges, flower bushes, and shrubs. A lone ornamental piece stands near the right edge, lit up with subtle garden lights.", "An emerald patch of grass is encircled by flourishing hedges and flower bushes. A couple of, heavy trees stands near the left edge, their leaves are full of nests, some abandoned, others very much alive. The flowers and plants are growing without boundaries, there's not even a single weed in sight.", "A neatly trimmed bed of moss-covered grass is contoured by joined flower bushes and shrubs. A single, gigantic tree stands in the front, its leaves continue to be home to countless creatures.", "An overrun patch of grass is neighbored by united hedges and shrubs. A single, stocky tree stands in the back left, its trunk and crown form an umbrella that shields the entire garden. The flower beds are unkempt, but look all the better for it; they're like a cloud of color.", "A luxurious garden of grass is neighbored by aromatic hedges and bushes. A lone, bulging boulder sits near the left edge, and on top of it stands a brass ornament.", "The forest was large, clear, and lush. Its canopy was reigned by linden, rhododendron, and oak, enough light shimmered through their crowns for a mishmash of sprouts to consume the brittle leaves on the ground below.", "Thick branches dangled from the occasional tree, and an array of flowers, which were unique to this region, added playful elements to the otherwise jade lower level.", "A variation of animal sounds, predominantly those of bird songs, brightened up the forest, and were out of sync with the occasional roar of a large animal trying to scare away predators.", "Quiet climbing plants dangled from many a tree, and a range of flowers, which desperately tried to claim the last remnants of light, stood out against the otherwise dark terrain.", "Curling branches hung from a couple of trees, and a mishmash of flowers, which desperately tried to avoid the shadows, enriched the otherwise jade landscape.", "The forest was colossal, dark, and flourishing. Its canopy was demanded by hazel, asp, and holly, enough light shimmered through their crowns for a medley of shrubs to claim the insect riddled soils below.", "Swooping creepers dangled from many a tree, and a mishmash of flowers, which were seen occasionally, protruded from the otherwise brown backdrop.", "The forest was tremendous, gloomy, and archaic. Its canopy was marked by larch, elm, and asp, their crowns allowed for short beams of light to descend for all sorts of herbs to spread in the sloping and slanting ground below.", "Thick vines dangled from most trees, and a range of flowers, which blossomed brightly, added colorful variety to the otherwise homogeneous lower level.", "A medley of sounds, which were caused by birds and vermin, filled the air, and added to the sounds of the trickling sounds of a gentle river stream.", "Quiet creepers grasped a couple of trees, and a medley of flowers, which grew in a sprinkled and disorderly fashion, looked almost out of place in the otherwise jade forest floor.", "A clamor of animal noises, most of which were varmint, reverberated through the air, and formed a chaotic orchestra with the occasional sounds of breaking twigs beneath the feet of larger animals.", "A tumult of wild noises, which were caused by varmint, resonated through the air, and were out of sync with the occasional sounds of large animals in the distance.", "A tumult of sounds, belonging mostly to birds and insects, reverberated through the air, and were backed by the splashing of fish in a nearby lake.", "Coiling tree limbs clung to a couple of trees, and an array of flowers, which were found in the most quiet places, added some color to the otherwise mundane lower level.", "A mishmash of wild sounds, belonging mostly to foraging animals, brightened up the forest, and were in harmony with the raging river currents clashing against boulders.", "The forest was endless, crowded, and ancient. Its canopy was marked by dogwood, poplar, and linden, and cascading lights bouncing between the leaves allowed for a variety of saplings to reign the moss covered grounds below."],

    "desert_landscapes": ["You stand in a flat region dotted with various dark rocks.  You can see a bog in the distance.  The temperature is cool and the sky is clear.", "You stand in a flat region spotted with unusual pale rocks. It's also sprinkled with various trees, dead shrubs, and grass.  You can see a monastery miles away.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is clear.", "You stand in a broken region abounding with gigantic brown stones.  You can see a castle to the south.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is mostly clear.", "You stand in a hilly terrain dotted with dead plants.  You can see a large lake close by and a fort to the south.  The temperature is cold and the sky is mostly clear.", "There were fields far and near, seemingly with no end beyond the horizons. All around you deer and horses ran and frolicked in the sunny pastures, and right in the center of the fields ran a muddy road.", "The road stopped at a typical estate overshadowed by several enormous oak trees. The estate was renovated recently, and thus in splendid condition.", "There were fields everywhere, on each hill, and every slope. All around you sheep and deer rested and grazed in the lush pastures, and passing through the various fields ran a dusty road.", "The road eventually reached a classic farmhouse after passing a rickety welcome sign. The farmhouse was old, but it didn't show. A large granary held an ample supply of animal feed, large tractors were parked beneath a rickety roof, and a small plot of land was used for a private vegetable garden.", "The plant-like organisms on this planet are almost entirely made up of bushes and shrubs, in all shapes and sizes, some can grow to incredible heights. They're supported by grasses and fungi on the bottom layers, but there are almost no flower species and trees do not exist on this planet.", ],

    "mountainous_landscapes": ['You stand in a mountainous region scattered with small trees and unusual grass.  You can see a waterfall to the south.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is mostly clear.', "You stand in a mountainous area covered with various colorful rocks. It's also smattered with small wildflowers.  You can see a marsh close by.  The temperature is a little cool and the sky is mostly clear.", "You stand in a mountainous region replete with gigantic reddish rocks.  You can see a marsh to the west and a tower to the north.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is mostly clear.", "You stand in a mountainous terrain spotted with gigantic trees and huge grass.  You can see a river not too far away.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a mountainous region scattered with various bluish stones.  You can see a stream to the west.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is partially cloudy.", "You stand in a mountainous region replete with unusual greenish rocks.  You can see a bog to the south and a town to the north.  The temperature is very warm and the sky is mostly clear.", "You stand in a mountainous terrain covered with gigantic pale brown stones.  You can see a stream miles away.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a flat terrain scattered with dead wildflowers.  You can see the ocean to the west.  The temperature is hot and the sky is clear.", "You stand in a hilly terrain spotted with huge purplish stones.  You can see a bog to the west and a castle to the south.  The temperature is very warm and the sky is clear.", "You stand in a broken area covered with unusual grass and foul-smelling wildflowers.  You can see a large river nearby.  The temperature is very warm and the sky is mostly clear.", "You cautiously venture forward through the enticing portal at the top of a dormant volcano. You're immediately met by an energetic world. A gentle breeze caresses your face as the rays of a blueish sun warm your skin."],

    "other_landscapes": ['You stand in a flat region spotted with huge trees and wildflowers.  You can see a waterfall nearby.  The temperature is hot and the sky is mostly clear.', "You stand in a hilly terrain smattered with gigantic dark stones. It's also spotted with plants.  You can see a small body of water not too far away.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a flat region dotted with various shrubs.  You can see a stream miles away.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a flat terrain smattered with worn-down gray stones.  You can see the ocean to the west.  The temperature is quite cool and the sky is overcast.", "You stand in a flat terrain scattered with small multicolored stones.  You can see a small body of water to the south and a tower to the south.  The temperature is somewhat warm and the sky is partially cloudy.", "Bulky braziers encircling each of the ten ivory columns light up the lower levels of the throne hall and cover the hall in warm oranges and dancing shadows. The gemmed runes on the curved ceiling dance in the flickering light while gargoyles and statuettes look down upon the granite floor of this radiant hall.", "A lavish throne of mahogany sits in front of a giant painting of the kingdom and is adjoined by five similar, but smaller seats for visiting royalty of other nations. The throne is covered in gilded inscriptions and fixed on each of the wide armrests is a diamond dragon. The thin pillows are a dark scarlet and these too have been adorned with adorned margins.", "The city of Amberhill was built amidst a large, rugged island and is truly a technological curiosity. Its wonder is matched by the backdrop of everclear skies which have helped shape the city to what it is today.", "The skyline is packed with elegant skyscrapers and each was more impressive than the next. Culture is rising in Amberhill and it has attracted a lot of attention.", "From the outside it looks rough, unwelcoming and gloomy. Hardwooden planks and stone beams make up most of the building's outer structure.It's difficult to see through the small, curtained windows, but the awkward silence from within can be felt outside.", "It's as disgusting inside as it is on the outside. Sqaured, stone beams support the upper floor and the lanterns attached to them. The walls are decorated with sport's memorabilia, though it looks like it hasn't been maintained or cleaned for years.", "A clamor of beastly noises, most belonged to herds of larger animals, filled the air, and were accompanied by the swaying of tree tops in the wind.", "Extreme weather conditions and violent tectonic plate movement make this planet unsuitable for any life. But this planet is still fairly young, so perhaps once it has aged and calmed down a bit, life might find its way to this world.", "The planet Draenor, named after a famous scientist, is a desert planet in a vast solar system with thirteen other planets. Draenor is about 8.8 times bigger than Earth and its gravity is about 6.87 times that of Earth.", "This planet may be devoid of life, but there's an abundance of resources, many of which are usually quite rare on many other planets. Life is certainly possible on this planet, as the conditions are just right, so this planet is a prime location for any species looking for a new home or for a place to gather resources.", "Resources are pretty much the only thing this planet is good for. Life will most likely never be sustained due to the harsh conditions and terra forming would be very difficult. But for any alien species advanced enough to mine other planets, this one would be a perfect choice.", "The plant-like organisms on this planet are mostly different types of grass, but they could be compared to flowers, as they come in almost every color and they have incredible scents. Trees and larger shrubs make up most of the higher layers, but flowers, fungi and bushes are nearly non-existent.", "The wonders seen on the surface are also seen underwater. A huge variety of corals and aquatic plants have made their home in the waters of this planet, both living in harmony with each other, at least in most cases.", ]
